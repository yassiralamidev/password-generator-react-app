## Password Generator App

This is a simple app that allows you to generate passwords (between 6 and 36 characters) created with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
You can check out the application here [Password Generator App](https://password-generator-yassiralamidev.netlify.app/)

  > I used the [react-toastify](https://github.com/fkhadra/react-toastify#readme) package to add notifications to my app.
